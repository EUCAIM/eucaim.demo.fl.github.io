## EUCAIM demonstrators - Federated Learning Platforms

As part of early release of the EUCAIM Data Federation Framework with preliminary proof-of-concepts on data federation, we're organizing technical demonstrators for showcasing the functionalities of EUCAIM Federated Learning (FL) frameworks.

### Data federation

Nodes part of the federation are not necessarily the final Data Nodes of EUCAIM Data Federation, as for demonstration purposes, data in use here correspond to public datasets provided by the simulated FL experiments designed in this demonstrator.

#### Nodes

- **FORTH**: [Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH)](https://www.ics.forth.gr/)
- **UB**: [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.bcn-aim.org/)
- **BSC**: [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://bsc.es)

### Federated Learning Simulated Experiments

The demonstrator includes two different FL simulation scenarios, on based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the other on Deep Learning (DP) algorithms.
